# Zippia Challenge

## ðŸ“š Idea

This project was made for the web development job opportunity given by Zippia. The project is meant to be a page that renders job posts and render them.

There's not much functionality but I cared about styling it well and making it as responsive as it could.

## ðŸ’» Technologies

- React.
- Typescript.

## ðŸ”® Libraries

- Axios
- TailwindCSS
- DaisyUI
- TRPC

## ðŸ”† Functionalities

- Back-end
  - Back-end was created using the Nextjs route api with TRPC, so there's no complete separate back-end. It works just like any other rest API but you can also search by specific items as you would using GraphQL
- Front-end
  - You can expand the job post
  - Click on the job to be redirected to the corresponding job page
